I had a really rough time with this assignment, and I have been under so much stress with my other courses and their exams and work. I submitted what I was able to do, as
even turning in this assignment late would have given me less points than I would get this work. It really hurt me to settle with this progress as my final submission, 
but it was the optimal decision due to being busy with work and even more classwork the next few days, as well. I wouldn't have had any time to make progress on the assignment.
